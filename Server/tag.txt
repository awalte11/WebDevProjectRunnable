//THIS IS JUST A SKETCH OF DATA STRUCTURE

id : MongoIDthing
name : String
pictures : Array //full of MongoIDs of pictures the tag is on
collections : Array //full of MongoIDs of collections the tag is on

Functions needed:
Constructor, to add to DB
Adder, for both pictures and collections - when a tag is added to one, call it on the tag passing in the ID
Remover, for both pictures and collections - when a tag is removed or the thing is deleted, call it on the removed tag, or all tags, to remove the id from the array

recommend use tag name as primary key, *not* the mongo_id. Name is already acting as key, simpler this way
